*This is the unseeable space in which machine learning makes its meaning. Beyond that which we are incapable of visualizing is that which we are incapable of even understanding.* - James Bridle

In "Duets in Latent Spaces," I navigate the domain where machine learning finds its meaning, inspired by James Bridle's contemplation on the spaces beyond our capacity to visualize or understand. This endeavor is conceptualized as a lecture-performance, designed to bridge the realms of the tangible and virtual, facilitating presentations both in person and online. It unfolds through a series of vignettes, each spanning 3 to 5 minutes, that illuminate the generative potential of human-AI interaction, inviting the audience into a collaborative narrative that melds human intuition with algorithmic precision.

Each segment is woven with personal stories, dance, histories about cybernetics, migration, post-coloniality and choreography. They venture into uncharted probability spaces, powered by bespoke applications I've developed to interface with advanced generative AI and machine learning models. These interactions forge immersive experiences that delve into the deep, unseen dimensions of data. By manipulating inputs, actions, and prompts, I navigate the AI models' generative processes, forging a unique cognitive link with evolving texts, images, and soundscapes set within the ethereal spaces of desire, memory, and digital consciousness.

Central to the performance are several technologies: p5.js, enabling creative coding in the browser; Next.js, for rendering server-side React applications; Large Language Models (LLMs), offering extensive capabilities for generating human-like text; and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), known for producing highly realistic images. These technologies underpin the performance, facilitating REAL-TIME dynamic interactions that highlight the creative and contemplative capacities of generative AI.

Moreover, "Duets in Latent Spaces" extends beyond the performance realm into live, interactive applications, making the underlying technology directly accessible. The apps themselves, alongside their source code, are available, inviting further exploration and engagement from the audience and the broader community. This transparency aims to demystify the technology, encouraging a hands-on understanding and critical examination of AI's role in shaping our perceptions of identity, creativity, and reality.

This work is a mutable invitation to ponder the unseen forces that mold our digital and physical existence, offering a nuanced perspective on the intricate relationship between human cognition and artificial intelligence. Through this work, I challenge audiences to reflect on the invisible dimensions that influence our world, bridging the gap between the known and the unknowable with each performance and application.

It has been performed at:

-. Unfinished Fridays @ Berlin Lake Studios February 23rd 2024.
