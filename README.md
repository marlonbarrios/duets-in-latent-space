# Duets in Latent Spaces

**Performance + software + sound + concept by Marlon Barrios Solano**

*This is the unseeable space in which machine learning makes its meaning. Beyond that which we are incapable of visualizing is that which we are incapable of even understanding.* - James Bridle

Marlon Barrios Solano explores an unknown probability space and the generative potential of relationships with AI models to co-create stories in real-time. Latent Space is a conceptual and mathematical space generated by algorithms, particularly those used in machine learning and generative AI models. Solano performs actions in latent space, especially with AI models, interacting in a way that generates outputs based on the vast, unseen dimensions of the data it has learned from. This involves manipulating inputs, actions, and prompts to guide the model's generative process. Performing in real-time within latent spaces becomes a strange relationship with mutating texts, images, and soundscapes; a cognitive coupling within a probability space of longing, memories, fiber optics, neural networks, and algorithms.
